# Sceme is Scheme in Scala

![Scala CI](https://github.com/certainty/sceme/workflows/Scala%20CI/badge.svg?branch=main)

Just another toy project of mine. Nothing to see here.
If you want to try it anyways, well then just run the following to get into the REPL:

```
make handrolled_repl
```

## Running tests

```
sbt test
```
