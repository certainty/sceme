# Sceme is Scheme in Scala

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/certainty/sceme.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/certainty/sceme)

Just another toy project of mine. Nothing to see here.
If you want to try it anyways, well then just run the following to get into the REPL:

```
sbt run
```

## Running tests

```
sbt test
